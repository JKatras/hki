        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Healthy Kids, Inc. (“HKI”) was inspired by our own journey of children, food, and health.  For the first few years of our kids’ lives, we ate for convenience because we were too tired to cook. That’s all we knew. If we ate fruits or vegetables, they came out of a can, and we were spending a fortune on juices, frozen food, and pre-made dinners. Little did my husband and I know that our diet was actually making us <i>sick</i> and <i>tired</i>. We didn’t want our kids to grow up as by-products of processed and fast foods, and we owed it to their bodies, bones, and brains, to give them as many nutrients as possible. No longer could busy schedules get in the way. So, that’s what led us to create the Healthy Kids Inc., meal planner.</p>
